 ## Using the prepared data from the prevoius section our classification tasks for every patient is:
 ###### 
• Detect virus type and presence

• Decide whether he is “at risk” patient

• Decide whether he is a potentially “super-spreader”

• Identify which factors (features) are more significant for the above classification tasks
###### i have done the following steps :
1. Load the preprocessed training set
2. Train five different ML models (training done via cross-validation on the training set)
3. Apply the trained models on the validation set and check performance
4. Select the best model for the prediction tasks
