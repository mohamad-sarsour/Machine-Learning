## In this section we will analyze the virus protein data collected from COVID-19 patients with unsupervised learning techniques in order to check the suspicions that the virus might have multiple mutations.
###### I have done the following steps:
1. Load the data from protein.csv file and Prepare it
2. Use unsupervised ML techniques and exploratory data analysis to accomplish the following:
   - Identify and differentiate between 5 covid-19 virus mutations [see the attached photo](https://github.com/mohamad-sarsour/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Virus%20Challenge-3-clustering/clusters.PNG)
   - Choose one model to label the given data
   - For each mutant virus, identify and describe its characteristics
   - Identify the 5 most useful protein features in discriminating mutation groups
