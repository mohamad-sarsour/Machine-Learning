## Like any machine learning project, our first step is data preparation.
###### I have done the following steps :
1. Split the data to â€“ train (50-75%), validation (25-15%), and test (25-10%)
2. Imputation - Filling up missing values
3. Data Cleansing - Outlier detection + Type/Value modification
4. Normalization - scaling
5. Feature Selection - one filter method and one wrapper method
